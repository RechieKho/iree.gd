# `iree.gd`

[IREE](https://github.com/openxla/iree) runtime in Godot through GDExtension, a mission to run machine learning model (e.g. Tensorflow lite) natively in Godot.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform                         | HAL Backend used |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Apple products (macOS, IOS)      | `metal`          |
| Desktops (Windows, Linux, \*BSD) | `vulkan`         |
| The rest (Android)               | `vmvx`           |

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, only Windows, Linux, \*BSD are able to build via github workflow.
> The rest will be available in future releases,
> thus you need to compile them on your own for individuals who want to try it out.

## Overview

This GDExtension provides:

- `IREETensor` - Hold data to be fed into or output by the model.
- `IREEModule` - Load model and run it.

### Preparation

You'll need to compile your models following this [guide](https://openxla.github.io/iree/guides/).
Make sure the backends is supported by your compiled models, based on [supported platforms](#supported-platforms).

Here we can know that:

- The function name is `"module.main"`
- The function takes one `1x50x50x3` float 32 `IREETensor` (`input_0`) as input.
- The function takes one `1x200x200x3` float 32 `IREETensor` (`Identity`) as input.

### Using `iree.gd`

After having your `.vmfb` bytecode ready, you could start using `iree.gd`.

There are 4 steps:

1. Load model with `IREEModule.load`.
2. Prepare input by feeding data into `IREETensor` through `IREETensor.from_*` variant or `IREETensor.capture_*` variant.
3. Send `IREETensor`s into loaded `IREEModule`.
4. Interpreting the output `IREETensor`s from `IREEModule`.

```swift
var module := IREEModule.load("res://model.vmfb")
var input := IREETensor.from_bytes(image.get_data(), [1, 50, 50, 3]) # Remember to consider the input type.
var outputs := module.run_module("module.main", [input])
for output in outputs:
    pass # Do something with the `output`.
```

## Sample project

The sample project is in `sample` directory. You'll need to generate the bytecode before running them.

## Build from source

Run these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RechieKho/iree.gd.git # clone this repo
cd iree.gd
git submodule init thirdparty # initialize all the thirdparty
git submodule deinit thirdparty/iree/third_party/llvm-project # Deinitialize llvm, we are not compiling the compiler.
git submodule update --recursive # Pull submodule content, this will take a while.
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . # Building the project, this will take a while, add `-j` flag to make it faster.
```

If you would like to compile LLVM from source, you'll need to set `IREE_BUILD_BUNDLED_LLVM` to `ON` when generating build files with cmake.

After compilation, the library will be in `build/lib` directory.
It will also update the library in the sample.
